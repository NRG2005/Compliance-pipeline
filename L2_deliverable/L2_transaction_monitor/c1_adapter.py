c1_adapter.py  —  C1 Velocity & Structuring (unified-pipeline adapter)

The C1 patterns live as SIBLING transactions in transactions.csv (same sender,
clustered in time), not in case_history. This adapter detects them with three
calibrated rules, anchored to the dataset's actual signatures:

  Velocity spike      : >= VEL_MIN_1H outbound legs from the sender within a
                        rolling 1h window. (Suspicious senders: 11-17/h;
                        clean senders: 1/h.)

  Structuring         : >= STRUCT_MIN_LEGS legs to the SAME beneficiary, each in
                        the structuring band, within a rolling window.
                        (Smurfing: ~5 legs of ~Rs 2L each to one EXT beneficiary.)

  Credit-line probing : >= CREDIT_MIN_24H legs with a credit purpose code
                        (P0013) within 24h. Recurring salary (P0008, monthly
                        cadence) shares the amount band but a different purpose
                        code and never clusters in time -> correctly excluded.

Regulatory anchor: PML (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005, Rule 3(1)(B)
integrally-connected sub-threshold series; anti-structuring proviso PMLA s.12;
RBI FRM MD 2024 EWS (Clause 8.3). (Per Layer2.pdf C1 citation index.)
