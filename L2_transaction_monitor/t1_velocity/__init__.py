Azure Function entry point for T1 — Velocity Check.

This is the function that Person D's L2 aggregator calls
inside asyncio.gather() alongside T2, T3, T4.

CONTRACT WITH L2 AGGREGATOR:
  Input  : dict matching TransactionPayload fields
  Output : T1Result as dict (call .model_dump() before returning)

USAGE:
  from t1_velocity import run_t1

  t1_result = await run_t1(event_payload)
  # or inside L2:
  t1, t2, t3, t4 = await asyncio.gather(
      run_t1(payload), run_t2(payload), run_t3(payload), run_t4(payload)
  )
