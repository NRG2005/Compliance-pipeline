-------------
All T1 threshold values in one place.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
  PMLA thresholds (₹50K reporting limit) and RBI velocity rules have changed
  before and will change again. A regulatory update must NOT require a code
  change — only a config change here (or swap this for Azure App Configuration
  in production).

PROFILE SELECTION:
  Assigned per account in baseline_fixture.json based on account_type +
  is_business. The cosmos_client returns the profile string; checks.py
  looks it up here.
