thresholds.py  (C3 — Graph / Network Flow)
-------------------------------------------
All C3 threshold values in one place (config-not-code, per house style).

C3 absorbs two legacy checks over a SINGLE directed graph of Cosmos DB
transaction edges built once for a 72h window and traversed twice:

  * T5  mule fan-in / fan-out
  * T9  PMLA layering round-trip

Regulatory anchors:
  - Layering (moving proceeds through intermediaries to disguise origin) is the
    money-laundering process defined in PMLA, 2002, s.3 — making round-trip
    detection directly relevant to the s.3 offence and the Rule 3(1)(D) STR duty.
  - The RBI FRM Master Directions, 2024 EWS framework (Clause 8.3, per advisory
    summaries) extended monitoring to non-credit / digital-platform transactions
    to identify unusual patterns — the basis for graph-level pattern detection.
  - Reference implementation: MuleHunter.AI (Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, RBIH).
